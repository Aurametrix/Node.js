Linear data structures

Arrays: Built-in in most languages so not implemented here. Array Time complexity

Linked List: each data node has a link to the next (and previous). Code | Linked List Time Complexity

Queue: data flows in a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) manner. Code | Queue Time Complexity

Stack: data flows in a "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) manner. Code | Stack Time Complexity

Use Arrays whenâ€¦

You need to access data in random order fast (using an index).
Your data is multi-dimensional (e.g., matrix, tensor).
Use Linked Lists when:

You will access your data sequentially.
You want to save memory and only allocate memory as you need it.
You want constant time to remove/add from extremes of the list.


 Non-Linear Data Structures
 Understand one of the most versatile data structure of all: Maps
 Know the properties of Graphs and Trees.
 Implement a binary search tree for fast lookups.
