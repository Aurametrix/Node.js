Managing International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurement data used in monitoring of oral anticoagulation therapy
https://github.com/marcelalmesberger/Digital-INR-Card

The international normalized ratio (INR) is a laboratory measurement of how long it takes blood to form a clot. 

INR = (patient PT/mean normal PT) ISI.

The INR is derived from prothrombin time (PT) which is calculated as a ratio of the patient’s PT to a control PT standardized for 
the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the following formula:

INR = Patient PT ÷ Control PT

PT, the time in seconds, is measured in plasma to form a clot

Devised in 1983, the INR provides a standardized method of reporting the effects of an oral anticoagulant such as 
warfarin on blood clotting. INR value is dimensionless and ranges from a score of 2.0 to 3.0. (If higher - 
blood is clotting too slowly; if lower - increased risk of developing a blood clot)

The INR method was developed to standardize prothrombin time (PT) results between different PT analyzers and thromboplastin reagents.

Home INR monitors are designed to aid in the management of high-risk patients taking oral anticoagulants.
